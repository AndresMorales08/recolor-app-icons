## Installation

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndresMorales08/recolor-app-icons.git
   cd recolor-app-icons
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```

3. Download the latest release of the script from the [Releases section](https://github.com/AndresMorales08/recolor-app-icons/releases). You will need to download the appropriate file and execute it.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the script to recolor your icons. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Place your icons in a designated folder.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python recolor.py --input <path_to_your_icons> --output <path_to_save_recolored_icons> --color <base_color>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_your_icons>` with the folder containing your icons, `<path_to_save_recolored_icons>` with the desired output folder, and `<base_color>` with the color you want to apply.

### Example

```bash
python recolor.py --input ./icons --output ./recolored_icons --color "#FF5733"
